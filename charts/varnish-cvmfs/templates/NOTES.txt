For this to work a node must be labeled with "varnish: cvmfs"
Node must have an IP visible from all the WNs that will use it.
Server will be accessible at http://<IP>:6081

Varnish configuration is as simple as possible. 
It defines backends (Stratum 1 and 0 servers), these can be overwritten using values.yaml.
Only GET and HEAD requests will be served.
Each requests starts from the first backend, so keep in mind the closeness of the stratum servers when ordering them in values.yaml.
In case the first backend does not serve a given repo, backend response will be 404. 
All 404 requests won't be cached and will be retried from the next backend in the list.
